# This is a sample workflow, feel free to replace it with your source code
#
# This workflow does the following:
# - reads current time and date information from an external API and stores
#   the response in CurrentDateTime variable
# - retrieves a list of Wikipedia articles related to the day of the week
#   from CurrentDateTime
# - returns the list of articles as an output of the workflow
